                <p>Today a war between a rebel group and the government has broke out. The rebel group accused the government of oppressing Darfur's Non-Arab population. In response to the attacks, the government launched an ethnic cleansing effort against Darfur's non-Arabs. Hundreds of thousands of civilians died as a result, and Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, was indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.</p>
